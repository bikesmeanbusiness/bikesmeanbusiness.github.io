<section id="why">
  <h2>Did you know...</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Business owners grossly overestimate driving customers by 200%+. Studies in <a href="https://findingspress.org/article/24497-local-business-perception-vs-mobility-behavior-of-shoppers-a-survey-from-berlin">Berlin</a> found retailers thought 22% of customers drove, but only 7% actually did. In <a href="https://x.com/BrentToderian/status/1683279436458901508?lang=en">Toronto</a>, retailers thought 25% drove when only 4% did!</li>
    <li>Protected bike lanes boost business! <a href="https://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/downloads/pdf/2012-10-measuring-the-street.pdf">NYC found a 49% increase</a> in retail sales on 9th Avenue after installing a protected bike lane. <a href="https://bikocity.com/salt-lake-city-streets-decision-replace-parking-bike-lanes-boosted-business/">Salt Lake City saw 8.8% growth</a> vs 7% citywide.</li>
    <li>Cyclists spend more per month than drivers. A <a href="https://bikeportland.org/2012/07/06/study-shows-biking-customers-spend-more-74357">Portland State study</a> found cyclists spent 24% more monthly at bars and restaurants – they buy less per visit but come 2-3x more often.</li>
    <li>Bike parking is efficient! <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nashville/comments/1etrj8f/bike_parking/">One car space = 8-20 bike spaces</a>, serving more customers and maximizing your storefront potential.</li>

  <h2>Choosing the Right Rack</h2>
  <p><strong>Best choice:</strong> Inverted-U or post-and-ring racks – sturdy, secure, and easy to use.</p>
  
  <h3>Why other racks don't work:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>"Wave" or "Ribbon" racks:</strong> Only secure the front wheel, bikes tip over easily, can damage wheels</li>
    <li><strong>"Comb" or "Grid" racks:</strong> Bikes fall over, only hold front wheel, can bend wheels</li>
    <li><strong>"Wheel bender" racks:</strong> Named for a reason – they damage wheels and don't secure the frame</li>
    <li><strong>Decorative/artistic racks:</strong> Often impossible to lock properly, confuse users, waste money</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong>Good racks allow:</strong> Two points of contact, U-lock to secure frame and wheel, support for various bike sizes.</p>
